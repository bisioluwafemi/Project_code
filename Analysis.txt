# PROBLEM 1

# Description

In response to pressure from federal and state agencies to monitor school effectiveness in the United States, the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) of the U.S. Department of Education conducted a survey in the spring of 1988, the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS). The participants consisted of a nationally representative sample of approximately 25,000 eighth graders to measure achievement outcomes in four core subject areas (English, history, mathematics, and science), in addition to personal, familial, social, institutional, and cultural factors that might relate to these outcomes. Details on the design and initial analysis of this survey may be referenced in Horn, Hafner, and Owings (1992). A follow-up of these students was conducted during tenth grade in the spring of 1990; a second follow-up was conducted during the twelfth grade in the spring of 1992; and, finally, a third follow-up was conducted in the spring of 1994.

# Details
this data contain some selected sub-sample of 500 cases and 48 variables. The cases were sampled randomly from the approximately 5,000 students who responded to all four administrations of the survey, who were always at grade level (neither repeated nor skipped a grade), and who pursued some form of post-secondary education. The particular variables were selected to explore the relationships between student and home background variables, self-concept, educational and income aspirations, academic motivation, risk-taking behavior, and academic achievement.


# Method of analysis and objectives

the objective of this problem is to test whether time spent on homework out of school per week in Grade 12 affects student’s math, science, and reading achievement scores and their self-concept in Grade 12 and the method of analysis used is called Regression analysis.

# Research question
which of the two groups, those who spent fewer than 4 hours on homework per week out of school at Grade 12 and those who spent 4 or more hours has significant effect on student’s math, science, and reading achievement scores and their self-concept in Grade 12?

# Research hypothesis
null hypothesis: the two groups has no significant effect on student’s math, science, and reading achievement scores and their self-concept in Grade 12
Alternate hypothesis: the two groups has significant effect on student’s math, science, and reading achievement scores and their self-concept in Grade 12

```{r Question1}
library(sur)
#Load the NELS data
data("NELS")
head(NELS)

summary(NELS)
str(NELS)
class(NELS$hwkout12)

# convert homework out of school per week in Grade 12 to numeric
NELS$hwkout12 <- as.numeric(NELS$hwkout12)

group1 <- subset(NELS,hwkout12 < 4)
group2 <- subset(NELS,hwkout12 >= 4)

#Regression analysis
reg1 <- lm(hwkout12~achrdg12+achmat12+achsci12+slfcnc12,group1)
summary(reg1)
reg2 <- lm(hwkout12~achrdg12+achmat12+achsci12+slfcnc12,group2)
summary(reg2)
```



# Interpretation
the first group which is those who spent fewer than 4 hours on homework per week out of school at Grade 12 has a positive effect on dependent variable which are Reading, math achievement in twelfth grade and their self-concept in Grade 12 respectively while a negative effect on science achievement in twelfth grade. the second group which are those who spent 4 or more hours on homework out of school per week in twelfth grade has a positive effect on dependent variable which are Reading, math, science  achievement in twelfth grade and their self-concept in Grade 12 respectively. the second group show that the model explains the independent variable by 85% while the first group shows that the model explain the model by 78%.

# Deduction
we can deduce from the P-value of both groups that the second group has a p-value (6.859e-07) less than 0.05, which implies that the null hypothesis is rejected and conclude that there exist significant effect on student’s math, science, and reading achievement scores and their self-concept in Grade 12 for students who spent 4 or more hours on homework out of school per week in twelfth grade while the first group shows an acceptance of the null hypothesis since the p-value(0.2699) is greater than 0.05, then we conclude that there exist no significant effect on student’s math, science, and reading achievement scores and their self-concept in Grade 12 for students who spent fewer than 4 hours on homework per week out of school at Grade 12. this shows that the more time the student in grade 12 spent on homework per week is a determining factor to their  achievement scores and their self-concept.

# Objective

the objective of the problem is to show and discuss the overall trend of adjusted opiates-related death rate by states in the South region.


```{r Question2}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the opiates dataset
data(opiates)

str(opiates)
# Subset data to include only states in the South region
south_states <- c("Alabama", "Arkansas", "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", 
                  "Kentucky", "Louisiana", "Maryland", "Mississippi", 
                  "North Carolina", "Oklahoma", "South Carolina", 
                  "Tennessee", "Texas", "Virginia", "West Virginia")

opiates_south <- opiates %>%
  filter(state %in% south_states)

# Calculate adjusted opiates-related death rate for each state
opiates_south <- opiates_south %>%
  mutate(AdjRate = (deaths / population) * 100000)

# Compute the average trend for the South region
avg_trend_south <- opiates_south %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(AvgAdjRate = mean(AdjRate))

# Compute the national average trend
avg_trend_national <- opiates %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(AvgAdjRate = mean(deaths) / mean(population) * 100000)

# Plotting
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = avg_trend_south, aes(x = year, y = AvgAdjRate, color = "South"), size = 1.5) +
  geom_line(data = avg_trend_national, aes(x = year, y = AvgAdjRate, color = "National"), size = 1.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Adjusted Opiates-related Death Rate by Year (South Region vs National)",
       x = "Year", y = "Adjusted Death Rate (per 100,000 population)",
       color = "Region") +
  theme_minimal()

```


# INTERPRATION

the graph shows a steep increase in death rates in the south region which implies that death rate increase from one year to another in the south region which is almost the same experience in the National. this shows that the south region are more affected corresponding to the National.



#PROBLEM 3

# Description
Data consists of specific Part I crimes (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, theft, auto theft and arson) and Part II crimes (all other offenses) that would be of major concern to residents. Data provided represents only calls for police service where a formal, written report was made and does not include other calls for police service that did not result in a written report.
